What is Memorization?
It is a programming technique that is used to increase the efficiency of function by storing the previous values that function has already been calculated. It increases the program efficiency by caching the results of the function calls.

What is Memoization?

In programming, memoization is an optimization technique that makes applications more efficient and hence faster. It does this by storing computation results in cache, and retrieving that same information from the cache the next time it's needed instead of computing it again.

In simpler words, it consists of storing in cache the output of a function, and making the function check if each required computation is in the cache before computing it.

A cache is simply a temporary data store that holds data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.
